## Title of Work
Glass Tile Wall

## ArtistProjectStatement
In 1996, artist Miyuki Shinkai worked with members of the community in Dunbar on the "Glass Tile Wall" project. Learning to paint their own portraits or image choices on glass made the project accessible and appealing to a wide range of neighbourhood participants, from pre-schoolers to seniors. Using this simple format, the artist fired the tiles, then assembled them into a mural in a grid pattern, with space around each of the 300 tiles. Seen together, the images on the tiles reflect everyday life, each tile set like a shiny "square" in a firm "quilt". - Park Board web site
