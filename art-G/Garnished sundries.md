## Title of Work
Garnished sundries

## ArtistProjectStatement
Garnished sundries presented on twenty transit-shelter posters throughout the city from January 3 - 30, 2022. 

Through this new photographic series of intimate household objects that have been cut up, collaged and reorganized, Svava Tergesen hopes to create an experience where the public can consider how domestic life has changed and shape-shifted throughout this pandemic.  

Tergesen was inspired by the history of the still-life &mdash; in which sumptuous arrangements of foods, glassware, pottery and plants were carefully rendered as paintings. Riffing on these conventions, Tergesen&rsquo;s work displays mutated objects that are no longer whole, but have been transformed into new hybrid creations. The photographs ask questions of the viewer: what differentiates a chore such as meal preparation from an act of play? How can the home be used or seen in new ways?
