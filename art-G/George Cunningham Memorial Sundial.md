## Title of Work
George Cunningham Memorial Sundial

## ArtistProjectStatement
Erected under the auspices of the Centennial Committee of Vancouver in cooperation with the Parks Board, the sculpture was presented to the City by Cunningham Drug Stores Ltd. whose first store was opened at Denman and Nelson Streets in 1911.  The inscription reads, " I mark my hours by shadow, mayest thou mark thine by sunshine." The sundial commemorates three English "greenhorns" - Samual Brighouse, John Morton, and William Hailstone who in 1862 filed the first land claim and planned the first home and industry in the then heavily wooded area now bounded by Burrard Inlet, Stanley Park, English Bay and Burrard Street to which they received title in 1867.
