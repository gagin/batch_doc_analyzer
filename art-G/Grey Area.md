## Title of Work
Grey Area

## ArtistProjectStatement
Paige Gratland&rsquo;s Grey Area presented on transit shelters throughout the city from November 30th to December 27th, 2020.

This photograph of Gratland&#39;s handwoven &quot;web&quot; was created during the early months of the pandemic as a way to process the uncertainty, injustice, grief, and upheaval that  marked our daily lives. The piece embodies the labour and meditative nature of time spent in my studio under lockdown, and is connected to the use of handwoven cloths as shrouds to cover or protect the body in birth, life and death.
